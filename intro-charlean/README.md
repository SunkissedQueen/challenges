‚≠êÔ∏è Challenge: Favorites
As a developer, you are tasked with creating an application to share your favorite things. Decide which favorite things you would like to showcase. When creating a project it is important to think about organization of your code. It is best practice to separate and compartmentalize all the actions in your code into individual components.

üìö User Stories
As a user, I can see a Header component with the title of your app.

As a user, I can see a Profile component with information about you and your partner.
- src/components/Profile.js

As a user, I can see a Footer component with the name of your cohort.
- src/components/Footer.js

As a user, I can see a Favorites component with a list of top five favorites (i.e. top five favorite TV shows, top five favorite songs, top five favorite taco shops).
- src/components/Favorites.js

üèî Stretch
As a user, I can see a browser tab with a customized name and favicon.
